#### Code Style

This project follows the same code style as Prezto. It is copied below for
convenience.

This project follows the [Google Shell Style Guide][1] when possible. However,
there are a number of additional things to keep in mind.

   - Local variables should be used whenever possible.
   - Prefer `zstyle` over environment variables for configuration.
   - Prefer (( ... )) over [[ ... ]] for arithmetic expression.
   - Use the function keyword to define functions.
   - The 80 character hard limit can be waved for readability.
